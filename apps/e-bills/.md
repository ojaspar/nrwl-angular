#### router transition/animation

in other for animation to be added to a route depending on how the slide in should be always add a data property to the route configuration
-Eg {
path: 'about',
component: OneComponent,
data: { animation: 'One' }
}


#### Inteface Declaration
-types should be properly declared before using also try to avoid the use of any as a variable type 
-all endpoint model should be gotten from the backend and stated properly before making a PR
-post request should include Observable type and response type clearly defined not any 
- eg{

	login(authenticate: Authenticate): Observable<User> {
    return this.httpClient.post<User>(
      'http://localhost:3000/login',
      authenticate
    );
  }
}

#### Using Reolve for child component 
- Using a resolve in our navigation routes allows us to pre-fetch the component's data before the route is activated 
- Using resolves is a very good practice to make sure that all necessary data is ready for our components to use and avoid displaying a blank component while waiting for the data.
- eg
    {
	    path: 'about/:questionSlug',
	    component: OneComponent,
	    resolve: {
	      data: QuestionAnswersResolver
	  	}
	}
